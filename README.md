# N.B.: THIS REPO IS PUBLIC BECAUSE IT IS A FORK

# Description
This repository is meant to mock some of Ignition's builtin libraries. In 
particular, parts of
* system
* java
* javax
* org

are mocked.

This allows a local programmer to appropriately import and use autocomplete on
a local copy of an Ignition project.

## Setup
Install all of these libraries to work locally with
```bash
python2 setup.py install
```
